Event Booking Website with Weather Integration
Developed a responsive event booking website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, allowing users to seamlessly book events on the clientâ€™s website from any device.
Integrated real-time weather updates based on the event's city using an external Weather API, providing users with up-to-date information on weather conditions for better event planning.
Designed and implemented RESTful APIs with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, handling user registration, login (integrating local and Google authentication strategies), and booking management. The server runs on port 3000.
Enhanced security by implementing bcrypt for password encryption, along with cookie-based session management to safeguard user data.
Managed the database by creating and maintaining schemas, tables, views, and stored procedures to ensure efficient booking data management.
